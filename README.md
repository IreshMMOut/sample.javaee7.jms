# Sample Java EE 7 - JMS 

This sample uses simplified API of JMS2.0. It contains couple of servlets for performing Point to Point messaging.The JMS Servlet provides means to send/receive messages to a queue.

This sample requires that you create some resources before you deploy the application. 

## 1. Create WAS and MQ instances
  You need to have a WebSphere Application Server (WAS) instance and a IBM MQ queue manager instance for testing the scenario. I'll use docker to quickly get a Websphere Application Server instance and MQ queue manager instance running to demonstrate the steps but you can always use the traditional way to get them running.

  ```bash
    # Create a docker network that was and mq containers are going to sit in 
    docker network create was-jms-mq

    # Create the WAS container
    echo abc1234 > /tmp/waspass # This is the admin password for WAS
    docker run --network was-jms-mq --name was -h was -v /tmp/waspass:/tmp/PASSWORD -p 9043:9043 -p 9443:9443 -d ibmcom/websphere-traditional:latest

    # Create MQ container
    docker run --network was-jms-mq --name mq --env MQ_DEV=false --env LICENSE=accept --env MQ_QMGR_NAME=JMSQM1 -p 1414:1414 -p 9444:9443 --detach -h mq ibmcom/mq
```
  Now you should be able to access WAS console on port 9043 and MQ console 9444 on the machine you are running docker.

## 2. Create the resources required for JMS communication on IBM MQ queue manager and WAS server 
  ### 2.1. Create MQ resources

  Copy the required scripts to the docker container
  ```bash
    docker cp scripts/mq mq:/scripts
  ```

  Create the required users and groups and all the required resources
  ```bash
  # Start a shell in the container as root 
  docker exec -u root -it mq bash

  cd /scripts
  chmod +x /scripts/*
  
  # Create user app and the group mqclient
  ./create-users-groups.sh

  # Create TLS certificate
  ./gen-tls-keydb.sh JMSQM1

  # Exit the root shell
  exit

  # Start a shell as the mq admin user (mqm in most cases)
  docker exec -it mq bash

  # Cd into /scripts
  cd /scripts

  # Create queue manager resources
  runmqsc JMSQM1 < mq-dev-config.mqsc

  # Grant the required permission
  ./grant-permission.sh

  # Exit the shell
  exit
  ```
### 2.2. Create WAS resources
Copy required scripts into the docker container
```bash
docker cp scripts/was was:/scripts
```

Create the required resources
```bash
# Start a shell inside the container
docker exec -it was bash

# Cd into the WAS profile's bin directory
cd /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/bin

# Create the resources using wsadmin scripting client
./wsadmin.sh -user wsadmin -password abc1234 -f /scripts/createMQJMSResources.py DefaultCell01 DefaultNode01 server1

# Exit the shell
exit

```

You should now be able to see the created resouces in WAS admin console. Take a look to examine them.

## 3. Package and deploy the application
First, examine the code yourself to see what it's doing.
   
Package and deploy the application to WAS server
```bash
# Package the application
mvn clean package

# Copy the war file to the docker container
docker cp target/sample.javaee7.jms.war was:/tmp/

# Start a shell inside the container
docker exec -it was bash

# Cd into the WAS profile's bin directory
cd /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/bin

# Deploy and start the application using wsadmin scripting client
./wsadmin.sh -user wsadmin -password abc1234 -f /scripts/installApplication.py DefaultCell01 DefaultNode01 server1 /tmp/sample.javaee7.jms.war

# Exit the shell
exit
```

Access the application on https://\<docker-machine-ip\>:9443/sample.javaee7.jms (Ex: https://localhost:9443/sample.javaee7.jms) and test!
